This is an assignment part of the data science masters program. It focuses on the exploration of 
the Geographic Analysis of Government Spending in the Greek public sector, with a specific emphasis
on the allocation of funds and contracts related to the Assignment of Works, Supplies, Services, and
Studies ("ΑΝΑΘΕΣΗ ΕΡΓΩΝ / ΠΡΟΜΗΘΕΙΩΝ / ΥΠΗΡΕΣΙΩΝ / ΜΕΛΕΤΩΝ") within the hospital domain.
